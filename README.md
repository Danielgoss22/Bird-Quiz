# Bird-Quiz

## Description

- I wanted to create a quiz for my friends to text their knowlege of birds.
- I have learned a lot about JavaScript and how syntax and spelling are extremely important.
- I was encouraged that while working through the timer elements I was able to understand how it worked and was able to move forward quickly.
- I became discouraged when working through the loops to iterate my questions but once I was able to get one working I was able to better understand how it worked.
- I was grateful for tutoring and the Ask BCS link because they were able to help point me in the correct directions when I was missing syntax or when I had on element overriding another.
